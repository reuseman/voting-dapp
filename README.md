# Peer to Peer and Blockchains assignment
A simple DApp for the elections of a Mayor in the magical land of Valadil√®ne. The vote is possible thanks to the Soul token, an implementation of the ERC20 standard. Contracts are written in Solidity, while the frontend is implemented with Svelte and deployed over [IPFS](https://valadilene.on.fleek.co/).

## How to start?
The [doc](docs/final_project.pdf) here contains all the information needed to understand the project. Otherwise you can simply run it by doing the following:

### 1. Deploy the Smart Contracts (backend)

Install the dependencies and optionally run the test to check wheter everything works.

    cd backend/
    npm install
    npm run test

Run an instance of ganache to have a test network on which the contracts can be deployed.

    npm run ganache

Deploy the contracts.

    npm run deploy


### 2. Deploy the DApp (frontend)

You can go over [https://valadilene.on.fleek.co/](https://valadilene.on.fleek.co/) where a deployed version over IPFS can be found. Otherwise you can build it yourself by following the instructions below.

Install the dependencies.

    cd frontend/
    npm install

Compile the frontend with Svelte and go over [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).

    npm run build
